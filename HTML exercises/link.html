	<h2 id="html">Learn HTML</h2>
	<p>This is very easy HTML course. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It structures the content of a webpage by defining various elements such as text, images, links, forms, and multimedia. HTML uses a series of tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets ), to indicate how elements should be displayed in the web browser.</p>
	<h2 id="css">Learn CSS</h2>
	<p>	This is very easy CSS course.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to control the appearance and layout of a web page. While HTML structures the content, CSS defines how that content should be presented in terms of design, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.
		With CSS, you can apply styles to specific elements or entire pages, making it easy to maintain a consistent look and feel across a website. CSS rules are applied in a "cascade," meaning they can inherit and override styles based on their specificity and order.</p>
	<h2 id="javascript">Learn javascript</h2>
	<p>This is very easy javascript course. JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language primarily used to add interactivity, behavior, and functionality to websites. Unlike HTML, which structures content, and CSS, which styles it, JavaScript allows for interactive elements like forms, animations, dynamic updates, and more complex actions on web pages. JavaScript can be used both client-side (in the browser) and server-side (using environments like Node.js).</p>
